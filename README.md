# clj-openid

Clojure OpenID library, based on openid4java.

Work in progress, only a subset of features have been wrapped. I know
very little about OpenID so if you have some expertise and would like 
to help out please get in touch.

## Usage

Add

```clojure
[clj-open-id "0.1.0"]
```
to your `project.clj`.

A full usage example inside of a [compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure)/[hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) web application can be found in `example.clj`.
